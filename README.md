##Abstract

This paper proposes a method to control a remote robot or avatar with a master's hand gesture for virtual interaction and teleoperation.
We classify a master's hand gesture in two phases - locomotion and manipulation.
A hand pose classifies the two modes, and a single hand gesture controls the robot/avatar motion.
We demonstrate the proposed method with a mobile manipulator.
